1. What are the null and alternative hypotheses?

The null hypothesis is that tech suits have no effect on swimmers, and the alternative hypothesis is that tech suits don't have an effect. The paper isn't trying to test wether they have a positive or negative effect, but the researchers are just tryiing to find if tech suits have any sort of impact on the performance of swimmers.

2. Who is collecting and analyzing this data?

The people collecting and analyzing the data are v. issurin, v. pushkar-verbitsky, and o. verbitsky.

3. What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?

This paper collects its data from the World Swimming Championships in 2009 and 2011. The results for the world swimming championships are available at https://www.usaswimming.org/times/data-hub/meet-results/world-championship-results

Results for 2009: https://websitedevsa.blob.core.windows.net/sitefinity/docs/default-source/eventsdocuments/meet-results/international-event-results/world-championships/2009-world-champships.pdf

Results for 2011: https://websitedevsa.blob.core.windows.net/sitefinity/docs/default-source/eventsdocuments/meet-results/international-event-results/world-championships/2011-world-champships.pdf

4. Why are they interested in this data?

The researchers are interested in this data because they want to find out the effect of tech suits. While trying to find the data fro the world swimming championships, I found a wikiepedia article for it which had a section on the controversy of tech suits from 2008-2010:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_World_Aquatics_Championships 

This research was likely done in response to that.

5. What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?

The data being recorded are the times for the 50m free, 50m breast, 50m back, and 50m fly 

6. What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?
7. How was this study funded?

This study was probably funded by the universities that the researchers worked at, which were the Wingate Institute, Savanah College, Technion Institution of Biomedical Engineering.

8. Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?

I think publish or perish might have had some effect on the study, since this paper feels a bit rushed. The first author, V. Issurin, did write other papers on swimming, since they were cited at the bottom, so this sport was probably something the authors were itnerested in. However,
