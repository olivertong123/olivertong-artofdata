1. What are the null and alternative hypotheses?

The null hypothesis is that tech suits have no effect on swimmers, and the alternative hypothesis is that tech suits do have an effect. 

2. Who is collecting and analyzing this data?

The people collecting and analyzing the data are V. Issurin, V. Pushkar-Verbitsky, and O. Verbitsky.

3. What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?

This paper collects its data from the World Swimming Championships in 2009 and 2011. The results for the world swimming championships are available at https://www.usaswimming.org/times/data-hub/meet-results/world-championship-results

Results for 2009: https://websitedevsa.blob.core.windows.net/sitefinity/docs/default-source/eventsdocuments/meet-results/international-event-results/world-championships/2009-world-champships.pdf

Results for 2011: https://websitedevsa.blob.core.windows.net/sitefinity/docs/default-source/eventsdocuments/meet-results/international-event-results/world-championships/2011-world-champships.pdf

4. Why are they interested in this data?

The researchers are interested in this data because they want to find the effect of tech suits on swimmers. While looking for the data from the world swimming championships, I found a wikipedia article for the 2009 WSC which had a section on the controversy of tech suits from 2008-2010:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_World_Aquatics_Championships, so this research was probably done in response to that. 

5. What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?

The data being recorded is the six leading times for the 50m free, 50m breast, 50m back, and 50m fly for men and women from WSC 2009 and 2011. There were 22 females and 24 males from the 2009 WSC and 22 females and 23 males from the 2011 WSC. The data being left out are the other events from the WSC. All swimmers from 2009 used tech suits, while all swimmers from 2011 did not.

6. What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?

Based on the data, the researchers found that on average swimmers from 2009 were 0.44s +/- 0.12s faster than the swimmers in 2011.
  
8. How was this study funded?

The paper doesn't specify who funded the study, but it could have been by the institutations that the researchers worked at, which are the Wingate Institute, Savannah College, Technion Israel Institute of Biomedical Engineering.

8. Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?

I think publish or perish might have had some effect on the study, since this paper seemed like it was rushed due to the small amount of data and it felt like the authors just wanted to take advantage of the tech suit controversy. However, the first author, V. Issurin, had some of his other papers on swimming cited at the bottom, so this sport was probably something that the authors were genuinely interested in and weren't completely just trying to get something published.
